      <h2>1. Niagara Falls!</h2>
      <p>Niagara Falls is just as AMAZING as going to disney land! You can watch the Wonderful Waterfall which has a boat that you can take a trip to! I reccomend, going to the CN Tower at night for dinner! Lastly, I would defintly recommend going to Ripley's Aquariam! If you have kids, thats the best place to go, in my opinion! Even if you dont, I sure you will LOVE IT! </p>

      <h2>3. Boler Mountain</h2>
      <p>Boler Mountain is a fun place to viste on winter break(When kids are free!)! You can even do this for Christmas or Christmas Eve as a fun Trip! To let you know, the Boler Mountain isnt exactly a mountain...It's actually more of a hill! They have skiing, snow tubing, and snowboarding! But in Summer, you can Hike, go one Zip lines, Mountain bike, and play beach Vollyball! This place is located in Byron, london, ontario! (Belive it or not, you can move to a house near bolar mountain! Its a GREAT Community!) I actually live right beside this wonderful place! </p>
